<h1>PowerStripHavoc</h1>
PowerStripHavoc is a WIP power regulation PCB for Wii Portables that sits on top of the Wii mainboard and inbetween the CPU and GPU. It is heavily inspired by YveltalGriffin's [Thundervolt](https://github.com/mackieks/thundervolt), loopj's [short stack](https://github.com/loopj/short-stack) project and different PCBs, and the [RVL-PMS](https://github.com/Gmanmodz/RVL-Power-Management-System) by gmanmodz. 

Its name is a combination of loopj's PowerStrip, which is the base of this project, and the Havoc weapon from Apex Legends. 

This Project is currently in the testing phases and is in no way ready to be used.
